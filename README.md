# Classic Netscape Throbber

Available here: (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classic-netscape-throbber/)

## Explanation

A fork and fix of Firescape Navigator, also called Chromescape Navigator, originally at (https://github.com/evansalter/chromescape-navigator) and renamed as to not collide with the original addon.

I had mostly one fix in mind: fix the truncated Netscape animation. The animation resets just as the foreground comet is transiting the scene. Using research done by Eryn Wells (https://erynwells.me/blog/2023/08/netscape-meteors/), I have fixed the animation using an idealized version of the original.

See (https://github.com/evansalter/chromescape-navigator) for additional details.
